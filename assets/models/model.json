    "body": "# Use case\r\n\r\nI want to show a list of users, but filtering this list is not _super_ fast, in a custom implementation I was able to use stateful widgets and callbacks (streams might have been better) that update al the widgets when search is changed. all this would be handled outside of a build function and the widgets could call setState().\r\n\r\nBut with SearchDelegate this is not possible since you only have a synchronous buildSuggestions which is called upon text change but is also inside a build function.\r\nSo I have to do all the computation synchronously. Using a ListView.Builder helps in that I can avoid filtering offscreen users, but when you search for the last person it still goes through all the users.\r\n\r\nBeing able to use a onTextChanged method that is asynchronous instead of the buildSuggestions would allow users of flutter to have statefull widgets to do the computation asynchronously and avoiding high frame times.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nAdd an onTextChange method, and make it optional and if the onTextChange is not null call that and avoid rebuilding the suggestions. Call the buildSuggestions once for the initial widget.",
